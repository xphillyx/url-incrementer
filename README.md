# About
URLI can help you increment URLs. For example, if the URL has a "page=1" in it or if there's a Next link on the page, URLI can get you to "page=2" in a variety of ways.

# Notes
1. Mapping shortcut keys to mouse buttons with 3rd party apps like Logitech Gaming Software is not supported and may only work if you use Logitech's "Multikey Macro" option.
2. Download Incrementing is an optional and experimental feature that is designed to be used with Auto so you can have a unique Multiple Page Downloader (think a simple "Down them all" that can run automatically!). It uses a custom-built downloader that I've developed for URLI.
3. URLI's Toolkit is a toolkit I made to help me develop and test URLI, but I've "unlocked" for you to use as a non-standard feature!
4. Saving URLs is completely optional. URLI only saves URLs as cryptographic hashes that are stored on your device's local storage -- not in the cloud.
5. Firefox only: Local file:// URLs may not increment due to a bug in Firefox (Bug 1266960).
6. Firefox only: URLI's Popup may not work in Private Windows due to the different way Firefox decided to handle this in respect to Chrome (Bug 1329304).
7. Firefox only: Firefox 60 (non ESR) Users won't be able to grant Download permissions on the Options page due to a bug in Firefox 60 (Bug 1382953); please update to Firefox 61 or higher.

# Permissions Justification
URL Incrementer requires no special permissions on Chrome and Edge. However, the Firefox version requires the <all_urls> permission in order to offer Internal Shortcuts because Firefox does not support the chrome.declarativeContent API to make this an optional feature like in Chrome/Edge.

*Optional Permissions*
URL Incrementer has some optional features that require extra permissions:
1. Browser Shortcuts - requires the <all_urls> Permission
2. Enhanced Mode - requires the <all_urls> Permission
3. Download - requires the Download Permission and <all_urls> Permission
